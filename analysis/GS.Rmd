* Download Gene set enrichment results for 3 factors from FUMA:

```
/project2/xinhe/shared_data/gwas_factor/GS/*.txt

```

* Only keep GO biological process results

```
df.list = list(f1,f2,f3)
res <- lapply(df.list,function(x) x[x$Category == 'GO_bp',])
res <- lapply(res,function(x) cbind(x,enrichment = x$N_overlap/x$N_genes))
res <- lapply(res,function(x) x[c('GeneSet','enrichment')])
```

* Calculate enrichment proportions and only keep it as well as geneset name columns

```
res <- lapply(res,function(x) cbind(x,enrichment = x$N_overlap/x$N_genes))
res <- lapply(res,function(x) x[c('GeneSet','enrichment')])
```

* Merge data frames according to gene set names

```
f = merge(merge(res[1],res[2],by='GeneSet'),res[3],by='GeneSet')

library(dplyr)
final = rename(f,f1_enrichment = enrichment.x,f2_enrichment = enrichment.y,f3_enrichment = enrichment)
```

* Calculate maximum differences and sort
```
final$max_diff = apply(final[,-1],1,max)-apply(final[,-1],1,min)
final <- final[order(-final$max_diff),]
```
