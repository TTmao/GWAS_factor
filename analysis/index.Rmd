## Data and preprocessing

1. The original GWAS data is obtained from [Kettunen, J., Demirkan, A., WÃ¼rtz, P. et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms11122). (**N = 24925**).

2. Then the data is applied with GFA as described in [Morrison, J. et al. ](https://www.sugarsync.com/pf/D7756315_09926538_686664). The first three factors can be obtained from

```
/project2/xinhe/jean/gwas_factors/data_analysis/2021-03-25_paper_metabolites/results/2021-03-25-metonly_estL2_z_ff-1_maxmiss0_pthresh1_seed1_subInf.*gc.RDS

```

 Where * can be 1,2,3.
 
3. In order not to confuse FUMA of which p value to use, delete the p column, and rename p_corr as p.
```
# R dataset imported as f
library(dplyr)
f$p <- NULL
f <- rename(f,p = p_corr)

```

4. Three lists of corresponding top SNPs after clumping with plink with threshold **p < 5e-8** can be obtained from

```
/project2/xinhe/jean/gwas_factors/data_analysis/2021-03-25_paper_metabolites/f*_top_vars.RDS
```

5. Since FUMA only recognizes input files as plain texts with tab as delimiters, all these .RDS files must be written as .tsv tables after loading into RStudio:

```
write.table(f, file = 'f.tsv', quote = FALSE, sep = '\t', col.name = NA)

```
6. Gzip the GWAS data because of the 600Mb limit.

## Run [FUMA](https://fuma.ctglab.nl/)

* Go for SNP2GENE
* Upload zipped GWAS TSV file for each factor and its corresponding top SNPs list.
* Type in sample size N. All other parameters are default. Then submit job.

## Results
* [Factor 1](factor_1.html)
* [Factor 2](factor_2.html)
* [Factor 3](factor_3.html)
